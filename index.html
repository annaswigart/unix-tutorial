  sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when
  you order it. It was amazing. While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I
  had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and

</p>

<pre> <code>wc -l yelp_reviews.txt</code></pre>
<samp>220,001 yelp_reviews.txt</samp>
<br><br><br>

<p>Note that using <code>wc</code> without the <code>-l</code> option will

<!-- ############################### COLUMN NAMES ###############################-->
<h2 id="col-names">Column names</h2>

<p>What are the column names for this file? Let's look at the first row. The
  <code>head</code> command will print the first few lines of the file. The
  <code>-1</code> option will give just the first row.
</p>

<p>You will need to reference these columns by their column number in later
  comands, so it is useful to view the names along with their column
  number. </p>

<p> We can use the <code>tr</code> command (translate) to replace the pipe
  character with a new line, and then print this output with each item
  enumerated, using the <code>-n</code> option of <code>cat</code>.

<hr class="col-md-12">

<!-- ############################### STARS ###############################-->
<h2 id="stars">Star ratings</h2>

<p>Are the star ratings all whole numbers? Let's check.</p>

<p>We know that stars is the 4th column. By using the <code>cut</code> command,
  we can pull out the stars column.</p>

<p>Our file delimiter here is a pipe character, so we specify the cut delimiter
  option as <code>-d\|</code>. Since the pipe has a special meaning in the
  command line, we must escape it with a backslash.</p>

<p>The field we want to select is stars, which is the 4th column. Unix indexes
  columns numerically (starting with 1), so we specify <code>-f4</code> to
  select the 4th column.</p>

<p><b>Now we are ready to find the unique values!</b> To do this we use the
  <code>uniq</code> command, which takes sorted data. (Note that <code>sort |
    uniq</code> is equivalent to <code>sort -u</code>.)
</p>

<pre> <code>cut -d\| -f4 yelp_reviews.txt | sort | uniq</code></pre>
<samp>
  1.0 <br>
  2.0 <br>
  3.0 <br>
  4.0 <br>
  5.0 <br>
  stars</samp>
<br><br><br>

<p>Notice that the value from row 1 (the column header) is returned as one of
  the unique values. Before sorting, <code>tail + 2</code> will filter your
  selection to only include rows 2 to the end.</p>
<pre> <code>cut -d\| -f4 yelp_reviews.txt | tail +2 | sort | uniq</code></pre>

<!-- ############################### UNIQUE USERS ###############################-->
<h2 id="unique-users">Count Users</h2>

<p>How many unique users have left reviews? We can use <code>cut</code> to
  select the user column, <code>uniq</code> to get the unique users, and <code>wc
    -l</code> to get a count of those lines.
</p>

<pre> <code>cut -d\| -f7 yelp_reviews.txt | tail +2 | sort | uniq | wc -l</code></pre>

<!-- ############################### TOP 10 USERS ###############################-->
<h2 id="top-10-users">Top 10 Users</h2>

<p>Who are the top 10 users who have written the most reviews, and how many did
  they write? From the previous example, we can use the <code>uniq -c</code>
  option to counts of how many times each duplicate user id is seen. We can
  then pipe the results to <code>sort -r</code> to sort the counts in
  descending order, and use <code>head -10</code> to view the top 10.

<!-- ############################## FUNNIEST REVIEWS ###############################-->
<h2 id="funniest-reviews">Funniest Reviews</h2>

<p>We have used the <code>sort</code> command as an input to the
  <code>uniq</code> command, but it can be useful on its own as well.</p>

<p>Let's use it to find the <b>funniest reviews</b> as voted by yelp users.
  Since <code>sort</code> will now be acting on data with more than one column,
  we need to use the <code>-t</code> option to specify the delimiter.</p>

<p>The <code>-k</code> option lets us specify which field to sort by.<br>
  The <code>-n</code> option is used to sort <b>numbers</b>.<br>
  The <code>-r</code> option <b>reverses</b> the sort to be from highest to
  lowest. Below, we'll look at the ten funniest reviews.

<!-- ############################## SED REPLACEMENT ###############################-->
<h2 id="sed-replace">Replacing with sed</h2>

<p>Let's say we want all of the column names to use underscores instead of
  periods to separate words. We can use <code>sed</code> to make this
  replacement.</p>

<p>Sed expressions are enclosed in single quotes. Our sed expression wills
  start with a <code>1</code>, since we only want to perform substitution of
  the first line (the header).</p>

<p>Then, we'll use the <b>s/to_replace/replace_with</b> syntax to replace the
  periods (which need to be escaped), since the period is a special character
  in regular expressions, with an <code>_</code>. Finally, the substitution
  expression needs to end with a <code>g</code>, to specify that we want to
  replace all occurrences of <code>.</code> with <code>_</code>. To just look
  at the results, rather than write to a file,
</p>

<p>If we wanted to output the changed header and the unchanged data to a file,
  we'd replace the | less with a > filename.txt. If we did <code>sed
    '1s/\./_/g' yelp_reviews.txt > yelp_reviews.txt</code>, we'd overwrite the
  original file, so use sed with care!</p>

<hr class="col-md-12">

<!-- ############################### GREP STEAK ###############################-->
<h2 id="grep-steak">Grep steak reviews</h2>

<p>How many reviews mention the word steak? We can use grep to search for
  "steak", with the <code>-c</code> option to output a <b>count</b> (without
  <code>-c</code>, your console will print all of the lines that contain
  steak!).</p>

<pre> <code>grep -c "steak" yelp_reviews.txt</code></pre>
<samp>7139</samp>
<br><br><br>

<p>If we also want to make our search <b>case-insenitive</b> (so we can also
  match STEAK and Steak), we can use the <code>-i</code> option of grep.</p>

<pre> <code>grep -ci "steak" yelp_reviews.txt</code></pre>
<samp>8031</samp>
<br><br><br>

<p>The above grep searches will also match things like <b>cheesesteak</b>. If
  we just want to focus on the steak, we can use grep's <code>-w</code> option,
  which requires steak to be the whole word.</p>

<pre> <code>grep -ciw "steak" yelp_reviews.txt</code></pre>
<samp>6622</samp>
<br><br><br>

<p>However, with the above, we lose the ability to find "steaks". To match both
  steak and steaks as whole words, we can use the <code>?</code> regular
  expression to match an optional ending s. By default, <code>grep</code>
  assumes the quoted pattern that you provide is a <i>basic regular
    expression</i>. In basic regular expressions, the <code>?</code> needs to
  be escaped so it is not interpreted as a literal question mark in the phrase.
</p>

<pre> <code>grep -ciw "steaks\?" yelp_reviews.txt</code></pre>
<samp>7263</samp>
<br><br><br>

<p>If we want our downstream analysis to be steak-centric, we could use grep to
  <b>output our results to a file</b>. Remove to remove the <code>-c</code>
  option, so that you get the lines, and not just the count of lines</p>

<pre> <code>grep -iw "steaks\?" yelp_reviews.txt >
  steak_reviews.txt</code></pre>

<hr class="col-md-12">


<!-- ############################### OMG grep ###############################-->
<h2 id="omg-grep">OMG grep</h2>

<p>Let's say we wanted to find reviews written with strong emotion. Let's find
  all of the reviews that begin with OMG (in all caps, as a whole word). To
  find OMG at the beginning of the review column, we need to use
  <code>cut</code> to extract the 5th column, then use <code>grep</code> with
  the <code>^</code> regular expression to match the beginning of the line.</p>

<h2 id="omg-awk">OMG awk</h2>

  in order to find the reviews that begin with OMG. <b>Now how do we get all of
    the other columns back?</b></p>

<p>Enter the <code>awk</code> command. With <code>awk</code>, we can apply
  regular expressions to particular columns. The <code>-F</code> option
  specifies the delimiter for the file. Within the seleciton criteria, the
  <code>$5</code> selects the 5th column, the <code>~</code> is used for
  matching a regular expression (to match everything but an expression, use
  <code>!~</code>) and the part between the <code>/ /</code> is the regular
  expression we want to match. </p>

<p>Now that we've introduced <code>awk</code>, let's use it for numerical
  subsetting.</p>

<p>What if we want pull out the reviews that have at least 50 useful votes, and
  look at only the votes.useful and text columns?</p>

<pre> <code>awk -F\| '$10>=50 {print $10,$5}' yelp_reviews.txt</code></pre>

  definitely it.<br>
  68.0 The orange chicken is great. This place is always packed.<br>
  120.0 This was the 4th service I tried. The other pet sitters I used didn't
  follow my instructions and some wouldn't even return my calls when I checked
  to see how my pets were doing. I can't say enough about Amanda's Pet Sitting!
  Amanda followed my instructions perfectly and was always in touch with me and
  returned my phone calls right away. I've used her services for years now and
  I'm always happy with her service. I recommend Amanda to everyone I know that
  has pets. <br>...</samp>

<br><br>

<p>You'll notice that the output is formatted such that there is space between
  column 10 and column 5. If we wanted to use the <code>|</code> delimiter, we
  would do it like so:</p>

<pre> <code>awk -F\| '$10>=50 {print $10"|"$5}' yelp_reviews.txt</code></pre>

<p>From the last example, you can see how you can use <code>awk</code> to
  extract certain columns subset data, and even rearrange columns. We used the
  cut command earlier to extract certain fields, but cut cannot rearrange
  columns.</p>

<p>The above examples only touch on the very basics of <code>awk</code>. Awk
  can be combined with shell scripting for numerical processing functionality.
