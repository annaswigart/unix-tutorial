                <h2 id="regex">Regular Expressions</h2>
                <p>The commands in this section take advantage of regular expressions to do advanced pattern matching. Here, we list some of the essential regular expressions to know. If you are new to regular expressions or want to learn more, please visit some of the suggested resources.</p>

                <p><b>Representing single characters</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>.</code> matches anything</li>
                    <li><code>\d</code> matches a digit</li>
                    <li><code>\D</code> matches a non-digit</li>
                    <li><code>\s</code> matches whitespace</li>
                    <li><code>\S</code> matches non-whitespace</li>
                    <li><code>a</code> matches a</li>
                    <li><code>[abc]</code> matches any character a, b, or c</li>
                    <li><code>[a-c]</code> matches any character a, b, or c</li>
                    <li><code>[a-zA-Z]</code> matches any character a-z or A-Z</li>
                    <li><code>[a-zA-Z0-9]</code> matches any character a-z or A-Z or number</li>
                    <li><code>[^abc]</code> matches any character not a, b, or c</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p><b>Specifying Sequences</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>a*</code> matches 0 or more occurences of a</li>
                    <li><code>a?</code> matches 0 or 1 occurences of a</li>
                    <li><code>a+</code> matches 1 or more occurences of a</li>
                    <li><code>a{x}</code> matches x occurences of a</li>
                    <li><code>a{x,}</code> matches at least x occurences of a</li>
                    <li><code>a{x,y}</code> matches between x and y occurences of a</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p><b>Specifying Locations</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>^abc</code> matches abc at the beginning of the line</li>
                    <li><code>abc$</code> matches abc at the end of the line</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p>It is important to note that regular expressions make use of <i>‘metacharacters’</i> like <code>*</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>+</code>, etc. If you want to use regular expressions to, for example, find lines that end with a question mark, you would need to escape the question mark with a backslash like so: <code>\?$</code>.</p>

                <!-- ############################### GREP ###############################-->
                <h2 id="grep">Grep</h2>
                <p>The <code>grep</code> command searches for patterns within files, and returns lines that have a match.</p>

                <p>The format of the grep command is <i>grep options pattern filename(s).</i></p>

                <p>Some useful grep options include:
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>-i</code> to ignore the case of the pattern when searching in the file</li>
                    <li><code>-v</code> to select line that don't match the pattern</li>
                    <li><code>-w</code> to select only lines where the match is a whole word (rather than a part of the word)</li>
                    <li><code>-f</code> to read in patterns from a file, one pattern per line.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p>The pattern given to grep can be a simple string or a more complex regular expression. To be safe, it should always be put in quotes so that the shell does not interpret and replace the metacharacters.</p>

                <!-- ############################### SED ###############################-->
                <h2 id="sed">Sed</h2>
                <p><code>Sed</code> stands for stream editor. It can do a lot, but we’ll focus on its usage in substitution.</p>

                <p>The format of the sed command is <i>sed options 'address action' filename(s).</i></p>

                <p>The <b>address</b> specifies a line number or a range of line numbers: <code>(1,7)</code> would select lines 1-7. The <b>actions</b> include deleting, printing, appending, and replacing text.</p>

                <p>For substitution, the ‘address action’ part of the sed command takes the following form: <i>address/toreplace/replacewith/flags</i>. <i>toreplace</i> can be a regular expression. An important flag to know is <code>g</code>, which replaces all occurences of <i>toreplace</i> with <i>replacewith</i>. Without the <code>g</code> flag, sed only replaces the first occurence.</p>

                <!-- ############################### AWK ###############################-->
                <h2 id="awk">Awk</h2>
                <p><code>Awk</code> is a programming language useful for processing tabular data. The format for an <code>awk</code> command is <i>awk options ‘selection_criteria {action}’ filename(s)</i>. Use the <code>-F</code> option to specify the field delimiter for the file. The default delimiter for <code>awk</code> is contiguous spaces and tabs.</p>

                <p>The <b>selection_criteria</b> are like the addressing in <code>sed</code>, but can take advantage of <code>awk</code> built in variables. Built-in variables include:
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>$1</code> for line 1</li>
                    <li><code>$0</code> for all lines</li>
                    <li><code>NR</code> for record number</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p>The <b>selection_criteria</b> can take advantage of operators to subset the data. Operators include:
                  <ul>
                    <li><code><</code>, <code><=</code>, <code>></code>, <code>>=</code> for less than, less than or equal to, greater than, and greater than or equal to</li>
                    <li><code>==</code> for equal to</li>
                    <li><code>!=</code> for not equal to</li>
                    <li><code>~</code> to match a regular expression</li>
                    <li><code>!~</code> to match everything but a regular expression</li>
                    <li><code>&&</code> for logical and</li>
                    <li><code>||</code> for logical or</li>
                    <li><code>!</code> for logical not</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p>To use regular expressions in an <code>awk</code> <b>selection_criteria</b>, enclose them in forward slashes.The below command prints out lines from a csv file for which the first column begins with ‘words’ or ‘Words’:</p>

                <pre> <code>awk -F, '$1 ~ /^[Ww]ords/ { print }' test.csv</code></pre>

                <p>For our tutorial purposes, the action will be a print statement. In more advanced contexts, it can be an awk program.</p>

                <!-- ############################### STARS ###############################-->
                <h2 id="stars">Star ratings</h2>
                <p>Are the star ratings all whole numbers? Let's check.</p>
                <p>We know that stars is the 4th column. By using the <code>cut</code> command, we can pull out the stars column.</p>
                <p>Our file delimiter here is a pipe character, so we specify the cut delimiter option as <code>-d\|</code>. Since the pipe has a special meaning in the command line, we must escape it with a backslash.</p>

                <p>The field we want to select is stars, which is the 4th column. Unix indexes columns numerically (starting with 1), so we specify <code>-f4</code> to select the 4th column.</p>

                <p><b>Now we are ready to find the unique values!</b> To do this we use the <code>uniq</code> command, which takes sorted data. (Note that  <code>sort | uniq</code> is equivalent to <code>sort -u</code>.)
                </p>

                <pre> <code>cut -d\| -f4 yelp_reviews.txt | sort | uniq</code></pre>

                <p>Notice that the value from row 1 (the column header) is returned as one of the unique values. Before sorting, <code>tail + 2</code> will filter your selection to only include rows 2 to the end.</p>
                <pre> <code>cut -d\| -f4 yelp_reviews.txt | tail +2 | sort | uniq</code></pre>

                <p>We have used the <code>sort</code> command as an input to the <code>uniq</code> command, but it can be useful on its own as well.</p> 

                <p>Let's use it to find the <b>funniest reviews</b> as voted by yelp users. Since <code>sort</code> will now be acting on data with more than one column, we need to use the <code>-t</code> option to specify the delimiter.</p> 

                <p>The <code>-k</code> option lets us specify which field to sort by.<br> 
                  The <code>-n</code> option is used to sort <b>numbers</b>.<br> 
                  The <code>-r</code> option <b>reverses</b> the sort to be from highest to lowest. Below, we'll look at the ten funniest reviews.

                <p>Let's say we want all of the column names to use underscores instead of periods to separate words. We can use <code>sed</code> to make this replacement.</p>
                
                <p>Sed expressions are enclosed in single quotes. Our sed expression wills start with a <code>1</code>, since we only want to perform substitution of the first line (the header).</p>

                <p>Then, we'll use the <b>s/to_replace/replace_with</b> syntax to replace the periods (which need to be escaped), since the period is a special character in regular expressions, with an <code>_</code>. Finally, the substitution expression needs to end with a <code>g</code>, to specify that we want to replace all occurrences of <code>.</code> with <code>_</code>.

                <h2 id="grep-steak">Grep steak reviews</h2>
                <p>How many reviews mention the word steak? We can use grep to search for "steak", with the <code>-c</code> option to output a <b>count</b> (without <code>-c</code>, your console will print all of the lines that contain steak!).</p>

                <pre> <code>grep -c "steak" yelp_reviews.txt</code></pre>
                <samp>7139</samp>
                <br><br><br>

                <p>If we also want to make our search <b>case-insenitive</b> (so we can also match STEAK and Steak), we can use the <code>-i</code> option of grep.</p>

                <pre> <code>grep -ci "steak" yelp_reviews.txt</code></pre>
                <samp>8031</samp>
                <br><br><br>

                <p>The above grep searches will also match things like <b>cheesesteak</b>. If we just want to focus on the steak, we can use grep's <code>-w</code> option, which requires steak to be the whole word.</p>

                <pre> <code>grep -ciw "steak" yelp_reviews.txt</code></pre>
                <samp>6622</samp>
                <br><br><br>

                <p>However, with the above, we lose the ability to find "steaks". To match both steak and steaks as whole words, we can use the <code>?</code> regular expression to match an optional ending s. By default, <code>grep</code> assumes the quoted pattern that you provide is a <i>basic regular expression</i>. In basic regular expressions, the <code>?</code> needs to be escaped so it is not interpreted as a literal question mark in the phrase.</p>

                <pre> <code>grep -ciw "steaks\?" yelp_reviews.txt</code></pre>
                <samp>7263</samp>
                <br><br><br>

                <p>If we want our downstream analysis to be steak-centric, we could use grep to <b>output our results to a file</b>. Remove to remove the <code>-c</code> option, so that you get the lines, and not just the count of lines</p>

                57.0 Absolutely delicious Mexican tamales!! All 4 flavors were incredible. Living in LA and at times Mexico, I know a good authentic tamale and this is definitely it.<br>
                68.0 The orange chicken is great. This place is always packed.<br>
                120.0 This was the 4th service I tried. The other pet sitters I used didn't follow my instructions and some wouldn't even return my calls when I checked to see how my pets were doing. I can't say enough about Amanda's Pet Sitting! Amanda followed my instructions perfectly and was always in touch with me and returned my phone calls right away. I've used her services for years now and I'm always happy with her service. I recommend Amanda to everyone I know that has pets. <br>...</samp>
                
                <br><br>
                <p>You'll notice that the output is formatted such that there is space between column 10 and column 5. If we wanted to use the <code>|</code> delimiter, we would do it like so:</p>

                <pre> <code>awk -F\| '$10>=50 {print $10"|"$5}' yelp_reviews.txt</code></pre>

                <p>From the last example, you can see how you can use <code>awk</code> to extract certain columns subset data, and even rearrange columns. We used the cut command earlier to extract certain fields, but cut cannot rearrange columns.</p>

                <p>The above examples only touch on the very basics of <code>awk</code>. Awk can be combined with shell scripting for numerical processing functionality.</p>
